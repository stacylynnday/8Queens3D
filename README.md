# 8Queens3D
Solves the 8 queens problem using Prolog

- This program finds a solution to the 3D 8 queens problem. That is, the problem of placing 8 queens on an 8x8x8 chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. The prototype board is passed in as a list with the rows instantiated from 1 to 8, and a corresponding variable for each column. The Prolog program instantiates those column variables as it finds the solution.
